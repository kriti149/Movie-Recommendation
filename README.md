# Movie-Recommender-Sysyem
This is a movie recommendation system created using nearest neighbour collaborative filtering and latent factor collaborative filtering. The dataset used is MovieLens 100k dataset.It first uses the nearest neighbour coolaborative filtering method to predict the movies for the user on the MovieLens 100k dataset and then uses the latent factor collaborative filtering on the same dataset. Both the methods give the good results on MovieLens 100k dataset and any of the 2 methods can be used to recommend movies to the user. In case of other datasets the results can vary and one method might perform better than the other depending on the dataset.
